Description: Analysis of longitudinal time-to-event or time-to-failure data. 
    Estimates the counterfactual discrete survival curve under static, dynamic and 
    stochastic interventions on treatment (exposure) and monitoring events over time. 
    Estimators (IPW, MSM-IPW, GCOMP, longitudinal TMLE) adjust for measured time-varying 
    confounding and informative right-censoring. Model fitting can be performed either 
    with GLM or H2O-3 machine learning libraries, including the ensemble-based 
    SuperLearner ("h2oEnsemble").
    The exposure, monitoring and censoring variables can be coded as either binary, 
    categorical or continuous. Each can be multivariate (e.g., can use more than one 
    column of dummy indicators for different censoring events). 
    The input data needs to be in long format.
